# What if there was a MOU and KE/KTP between AirBnB and Kingston University. Imagine a South Asian family is thinking of sending their daughter to London to study Fashion. Kingston has a high value, 1 week “Education Experience”  course called Queens Week. Through a MOU partnership with HRP Hampton Court, a parent and prospective student get to study royal dress and make a Tyvek replica to their size over the course of a week. Facilitated by Kingston’s unique AFHEA and Makerversity  accredited ’Creative Practitioners’. AirBnB facilitates accommodation - unique Kingston student residences and certified partners like The Rex Kingston. This is a disruptive model, advertising the University and Kingston.  Advertise for high income / value prospective students overseas through the tourist board. Promoting Kingston’s royal heritage and world class education. TripAdvisor rating. There could be out-of-hours local experiences for families like a special evening event hosted my Community Brain in the FuseBox, telling stories about the local neighbourhood. What value could this have? Does this have a market? An affluent target consumer. How much could the university charge if it’s viable?

This model—a synergistic, premium “Education Experience” combining Kingston University’s academic heritage, local partners, and Airbnb-facilitated accommodation—offers strong value and clear market differentiation for affluent international families. Such a partnership, fused with local tourism and cultural engagement, positions Kingston as both an educational and lifestyle destination.

### Value Proposition

- **Distinctive Integration:** By linking Kingston’s high-quality educational content (“Queens Week” focusing on royal dress creation), hands-on creative practice, and local heritage (Hampton Court, The Rex Kingston, Community Brain at FuseBox), the programme delivers a unique, immersive experience not replicated by traditional university short courses.[^1]
- **Attractive for High-Income Families:** South Asian and other globally mobile families increasingly value ‘preview’ experiences—combining skill-based learning with cultural sampling—when considering overseas study. The comfort of parent-student co-participation, exclusive local events, and premium accommodation enhance perceived safety, status, and brand legitimacy.[^2]
- **Institutional Prestige and Pipeline:** The association with renowned local sites (Hampton Court), Creative Practitioners, and accreditation elevates Kingston’s global reputation while creating direct conversion opportunities for full-degree recruitment.[^3]
- **Tourism Synergy and Community Engagement:** Collaboration with local cultural actors (Community Brain, FuseBox) and the tourist board amplifies Kingston’s civic identity, strengthens partnerships, and provides new revenue streams.


### Is There a Market?

- **Affluent International Segment:** The target market—families able and willing to spend for exclusive pre-enrolment experiences—exists and is growing. Chinese, Indian, and South Asian markets are particularly responsive to bundled education-tourism products that enhance cultural capital.[^4]
- **Competition Analysis:** No mainstream UK university currently offers a high-touch, integrated education experience directly with Airbnb and local partners. Comparable offerings by US universities (notably Ivy League summer pre-college programmes) charge premium fees, often £2,000–£6,000 per week excluding accommodation.[^5]
- **Proof of Concept:** Institutes like LBS, UAL, and Oxford successfully run high-value “experiential” short courses, though not with packaged local accommodation or parental involvement as a differentiator. The value is further enhanced by direct access to exclusive local experiences and endorsement from trusted tourism platforms (TripAdvisor/Airbnb).[^6][^7][^8]


### Pricing and Viability

**Potential pricing (if delivered as described):**


| Package Element | Approx. Price Range (GBP) | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| “Queens Week” tuition (incl. materials, activities) | £1,500–£2,500[^8][^6] | Comparable to highly ranked creative short-courses in London, with premium for HRP content and practitioner accreditation |
| Accommodation (Airbnb/student residences, premium partner) | £500–£1,200 | 7 nights, options for premium/exclusive local partners |
| Local/cultural experiences (FuseBox event, tours) | £150–£400 | Per person, bundled into overall experience |
| Total exclusive package | **£2,200–£4,100** | per participant; parent \& child packages could be tiered |

- **Upscale positioning:** The ability to offer “parent-child” packages and bespoke experiences could allow upward price adjustments.[^2][^6]
- **Revenue sharing and local economic boost:** Accommodation partners (Airbnb listings and Kingston providers), local venues, and creative facilitators benefit from a share of proceeds. The partnership elevates Kingston’s international appeal and brings new “educational tourists” to local business.


### Risks and Considerations

- **Quality assurance and accreditation protocols** must be mapped in any MOU—Kingston’s institutional reputation and compliance may require careful vetting of accommodation/partner providers.[^3]
- **Operational complexity:** Coordinating multiple actors (university, HRP, Airbnb, local venues, creative practitioners) demands robust project management.[^2]
- **Regulatory, visa, and safeguarding issues** for minors and international guests must be proactively managed for legal compliance.

***

**In summary:**
This disruptive, packaged “Education Experience” could command £2,200–£4,100 per week and directly target the high-income international family segment, leveraging Kingston’s unique heritage and creative credentials. If marketed and delivered with strong oversight and local integration, it would offer real value and market appeal—differentiating Kingston and its partners from typical summer schools or university taster programmes.[^8][^6][^2]
